TweetMotif is a faceted/topic/summarizing search system for Twitter,
built on top of the search.twitter.com API.  http://tweetmotif.com


Do you just want the tokenizer?

All you need is two files:

* [twokenize.py][t]
* [emoticons.py][e]

Running TweetMotif
------------------

Prerequisites

* Tokyo Cabinet
* Tokyo Tyrant
* mod_wsgi
* Python: version 2.5 works

There are precompiled versions of the Tokyo infrastructure in `platform/`, for Mac
OSX 10.5 and Ubuntu 8.04-ish. In the off-chance they will work for your system,
uncomment the code that specifies to use them (`grep platform *.py`). You may also
have to muck around with `ld.so.conf.d` and `ldconfig` (on Linux) to get
`mod_wsgi`, which is inside Apache, to see them.

You also need to be running Tokyo Tyrant for the query cache. This is usually
inconvenient for just getting started; in which case, disable it by commenting out
the lines

    # the_cache = ....
    # @the_cache.wrap

In `query_cache.py`


Architecture
------------

There is a *backend* and *frontend*. The backend talks to search.twitter.com and
does all text processing, clustering, etc. The frontend is a Django web site with
normal and iPhone versions.

The backend makes extensive use of Tokyo Cabinet and Tyrant databases: for the
language model, and the query cache.

Both the backend and frontend are WSGI apps. Everything is set up to run through
`mod_wsgi`. They communicate via JSON-over-HTTP.

### Backend 

The backend is run through, confusingly enough, *frontend.py*. It also has a
primitive frontend for development purposes there.

### Frontend

The frontend is Django.  See *djfrontend/*.
